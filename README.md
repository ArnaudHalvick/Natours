- `userController.js` - User profile management
- `viewsController.js` - Server-side template rendering

### Models (`/models`)
Define database schemas and business logic:
- `bookingModel.js` - Tour reservation schema and validation
- `criticalErrorModel.js` - Error logging and categorization
- `failedBookingModel.js` - Tracks unsuccessful booking attempts
- `refundModel.js` - Refund request data and statuses
- `reviewModel.js` - Tour ratings and user feedback

- `userRoutes.js` - User account operations
- `viewRoutes.js` - Server-side rendered page routes

### Views (`/views`)
Pug templates for server-side rendering:
- `base.pug` - Main layout template
- Partials (`_header.pug`, `_footer.pug`, `_reviewCard.pug`, `_sidenav.pug`)
- Email templates in `/emails`
- Page templates organized by feature in `/pages`

### Utilities (`/utils`)
Common functionality shared across the application:
- `apiFeatures.js` - API query handling (filtering, sorting, pagination)
- `appError.js` - Custom error handling class
- `catchAsync.js` - Async error wrapper
- `dateUtils.js` - Date manipulation and formatting
- `email.js` - Email sending functionality
- `parseJSONFields.js` - JSON data handling
- `setJwtFromQuery.js` - JWT extraction middleware

### Public Assets (`/public`)
Static files served to the client:
- `/css` - Stylesheets organized by base, components, layout, and pages
- `/img` - Images for tours and user profiles
- `/js` - Client-side JavaScript with API interactions and event handlers
